# Performance Module

The Performance module manages choir performances with a simplified architecture that focuses on the core performance details. Detailed song management, musicians, and voice parts are handled through the Rehearsal module, which can be promoted to populate the performance with detailed information.

## üéµ Features

- **Performance Management**: Create, update, and delete performances
- **Simplified Structure**: Focus on core performance details (date, location, type, status)
- **Status Tracking**: Track performance lifecycle (upcoming ‚Üí in_preparation ‚Üí ready ‚Üí completed)
- **Performance Types**: Support for various performance types (Concert, Worship Service, etc.)
- **Statistics**: Basic performance analytics
- **Filtering & Search**: Filter by type, status, date, and shift lead

## üîÑ New Hybrid Workflow

The performance module now works in conjunction with the rehearsal module:

1. **Create Performance** (status: `upcoming`) - Basic details only
2. **Add Rehearsals** (status: `in_preparation`) - Detailed planning happens here
3. **Promote Rehearsal** (status: `ready`) - Detailed data merged from rehearsal
4. **Mark Complete** (status: `completed`) - Performance archived

## üìä Database Schema

### Performance Entity
```typescript
{
  id: number;
  date: Date;                    // Performance date and time
  location?: string;             // Optional location
  expectedAudience?: number;     // Expected audience size
  type: PerformanceType;         // Type of performance
  shiftLeadId: number;           // Overall shift lead (required)
  notes?: string;                // Additional notes
  status: PerformanceStatus;     // Performance status
  created_at: Date;

## üîÑ Migration from Old System

The old performance system with embedded songs and musicians has been replaced with:
- **Simplified Performance Entity**: Core performance details only
- **Rehearsal Module**: Handles detailed song planning and participant management
- **Hybrid Workflow**: Performance + Rehearsal integration for complete functionality

This new architecture provides better separation of concerns and more flexible performance planning workflows.
