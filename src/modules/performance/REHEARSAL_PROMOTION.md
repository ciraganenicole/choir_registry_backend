# Rehearsal Promotion Feature

## Overview

The rehearsal promotion feature allows a rehearsal to be promoted to populate a performance with detailed data when it's ready. This implements the "Hybrid Workflow" where performances start simple and get detailed data from rehearsals.

## üîÑ Workflow

### 1. Create Performance (Status: `upcoming`)
```http
POST /performances
{
  "date": "2024-01-15T19:00:00Z",
  "location": "Main Sanctuary",
  "type": "Worship Service",
  "shiftLeadId": 123,
  "notes": "Sunday evening service"
}
```

### 2. Mark Performance as In Preparation
```http
POST /performances/:id/mark-in-preparation
```
- Changes status from `upcoming` ‚Üí `in_preparation`
- Performance is now ready to accept rehearsals

### 3. Create Rehearsals
```http
POST /rehearsals
{
  "title": "Final Rehearsal",
  "date": "2024-01-14T18:00:00Z",
  "performanceId": 123,
  "type": "Performance Preparation",
  "rehearsalSongs": [...],
  "notes": "Final run-through"
}
```

### 4. Promote Rehearsal to Performance
```http
POST /performances/:id/promote-rehearsal/:rehearsalId
```
- Copies all detailed data from rehearsal to performance
- Changes performance status from `in_preparation` ‚Üí `ready`
- Performance now contains all songs, musicians, voice parts, etc.

### 5. Mark Performance as Completed
```http
POST /performances/:id/mark-completed
```
- Changes status from `ready` ‚Üí `completed`
- Performance is archived

## üìä Data Flow

- User must have appropriate permissions

### `in_preparation` ‚Üí `ready`
- Performance must be in `in_preparation` status
- Rehearsal must belong to the performance
- All rehearsal data is copied to performance

### `ready` ‚Üí `completed`
- Performance must be in `ready` status

## üí° Usage Examples

### Complete Workflow Example

```typescript
// 1. Create performance
const performance = await performanceService.create({
  date: '2024-01-15T19:00:00Z',
  location: 'Main Sanctuary',
  type: PerformanceType.WORSHIP_SERVICE,
  shiftLeadId: 123
}, userId, userType, userRole);

// 2. Mark as in preparation
await performanceService.markInPreparation(performance.id, userId, userType, userRole);

// 3. Create rehearsal (via rehearsal service)
const rehearsal = await rehearsalService.create({
  title: 'Final Rehearsal',
  date: '2024-01-14T18:00:00Z',
  performanceId: performance.id,
  rehearsalSongs: [...]
}, userId, userType, userRole);

// 4. Promote rehearsal
await performanceService.promoteRehearsal(performance.id, rehearsal.id, userId, userType, userRole);

// 5. Mark as completed
await performanceService.markCompleted(performance.id, userId, userType, userRole);
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### New Entities Created
- `PerformanceSong` - Links songs to performances with detailed metadata
- `PerformanceSongMusician` - Musician assignments for each song
- `PerformanceVoicePart` - Voice part assignments for each song

### Data Copying Logic
- Rehearsal data is copied to performance tables
- All relationships and metadata are preserved
- Performance status is automatically updated
- Existing performance data is cleared before copying (allows re-promotion)

### Error Handling
- Validates performance status before promotion
- Ensures rehearsal belongs to performance
- Checks user permissions for all operations
- Provides clear error messages for invalid state transitions

## üéØ Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Performance planning vs. execution
2. **Iterative Planning**: Multiple rehearsals can refine the performance
3. **Data Preservation**: All rehearsal details are captured in the final performance
4. **Workflow Control**: Clear status progression prevents invalid operations
5. **Flexibility**: Can re-promote if rehearsal data changes

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- **Partial Promotion**: Promote specific songs or sections
- **Rehearsal Comparison**: Compare multiple rehearsals before promotion
- **Automated Promotion**: Rules-based promotion triggers
- **Performance Templates**: Pre-configured performance structures
- **Audit Trail**: Track all promotion history and changes
